Rhino-Etl is framework for doing Extract Transform and Load of data aka ETL in C#. The purpose of the project is to show as simple as possible how to load two textfiles, join them and transform columns and finally put the rows somewhere. In this example it only puts them on the screen. I hope it will get people up to speed a little faster than it took me to realize that it was quit simple.

Latest version should be here: https://github.com/patriklindstrom/HelloWorld-Rhino-ETL
There are screenshots of what Nuget packages to load etc in the Images folder. 
The HelloRhinoEtl is the helloworld example. There might be more examples.
